# Testimonial Cards UI

## Welcome to a basic UI project! ðŸ‘‹

> Thank you again for stopping by to check out another one of my UI projects. This is a UI project displaying a landing page for a furniture company called JS_Furnitures. This was a fun project to built out because it really challenges my technical skills when it came to CSS for the most part. 

## How to git started with this project:
    * Install NPM or Yarn
        * npm i
        * yarn
    Once installed in the main directory, in your terminal type the following command
        * npm start
        * yarn start
    to run the application.
